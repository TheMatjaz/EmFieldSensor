Modelica model of an electromagnetic field amplitude meter
==========================================================

A basic Modelica model (written in OpenModelica) of a digital measuring
system for electromagnetic field amplitudes. The system converts the
input oscillating electric or magnetic field (ideally a sine wave)
into digital format through sampling and quantization. Then with a simple
integral, it computes the amplitude of each passed semiperiod of the 
signal.
